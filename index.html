									<h2><a href="https://github.com/Chidubem-Degaulle-Orazulike/Cardiowatch">CardioWatch(Detecting Cardiovascular Diseases in PPG signals using Deep Learning)<br />
									</a></h2>
									<p>In my final year project, I developed a deep learning model for the early detection of cardiovascular diseases using photoplethysmography (PPG) signals. 
										I utilized a combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architectures to extract temporal and spatial features from the PPG signals. 
										Furthermore, I integrated the HeartPy module, a powerful tool in the Python ecosystem for heart rate analysis, to derive additional insightful metrics from the PPG data. This enabled the model to analyze intricate patterns and variations in the PPG signals, potentially indicating cardiovascular anomalies. 
										The project underlines my expertise in deep learning, data analysis, and my passion for leveraging AI in the healthcare sector to improve diagnostics and patient outcomes. It's been set to private for business use, so contact must be made for me to showcase the code.

									<a href="https://github.com/Chidubem-Degaulle-Orazulike/Caloric_Calculating_Buddy" class="image fit"><img src="images\Picture2.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Caloric_Calculating_Buddy is a dynamic web application that I developed, and designed to be a comprehensive digital nutrient monitor. 
										The application is built on Node.js and utilizes a database (either MongoDB or MySQL) to facilitate user registration and authentication, data storage, and CRUD operations. 
										Users can add, search, update, and delete food items while viewing their nutritional facts. 
										An integral part of the application is its ability to calculate the sum of nutrients for a recipe based on user-selected ingredients. 
										The app also includes an API endpoint for food data access and robust form validation. This project was assessed at 78%, translating to a first-class grade.</p>

									<a href="https://github.com/Chidubem-Degaulle-Orazulike/RSA_Encryption/tree/main" class="image fit"><img src="images\Picture7.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										I developed a python-based software prototype that succinctly demonstrates the RSA encryption algorithm's functionality. 
										The program simulates the generation of prime numbers, the selection of a random number 'e', and the creation of RSA keys. 
										It also exhibits a communication scenario between users Alice and Bob, with potential interception by Charlie, demonstrating both the encryption and decryption processes. 
										The prototype includes a feature for testing the RSA system's potential weaknesses, allowing users to input parameters leading to problematic states. 
										This project not only illustrated my understanding of the RSA algorithm and proficiency in python programming but also my skills in user interface design and software testing.
